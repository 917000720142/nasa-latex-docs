NASA-LaTeX-Docs
================

To build the [NASA-LaTeX-Docs Guide](https://nasa.github.io/nasa-latex-docs/build/html) docs, start with:

```
source ./bin/setup.sh
```

Now you are in an environment where you can make changes and test. If you just want to do a full build and don't need to enter the development environment, simply do the following:

```
source ./bin/build.sh
```
