.. note:: All of these examples assume that your document is employing the :code:`nasa-latex-docs` class which loads all the necessary packages and defines the format settings. You should be able to recreate all of these examples by simply copying and pasting the code snippets below into your document :code:`.tex` file.
   
   Outside of the :code:`nasa-latex-docs` class, all of these examples maybe recreated by simply including the same package list as defined in :code:`nasa-latex-docs/support/packages/packages.tex`. An example is provided below: 

   .. code-block:: latex

      \documentclass[12pt]{article}

      % document preamble
      \input{nasa-latex-docs/support/packages/packages.tex}

      \begin{document}
      
      % document content
      
      \end{document}
